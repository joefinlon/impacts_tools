Contributing
============

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, and documentation are welcome.
Contributions from the IMPACTS Science Team are especially encouraged.

The impacts_tools package is intended to be a collaborative effort, so bug reports, enhancement requests, ideas for new features, etc,
are best communicated through the GitHub issues tracker in the repository. 

If you are new to git, version control, or GitHub, there are lots of great resources online for getting started. We'll be adding more 
information here as we fill out contribution guidelines.
