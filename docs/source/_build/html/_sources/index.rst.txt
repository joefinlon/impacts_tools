The Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) 
is a NASA Earth Venture Suborbital-3 (EVS-3) aircraft-based field campaign to study precipitation banding
in severe winter cyclones in the Northeast United States.


What is IMPACTS-TOOLS?
======================
This package contains a collection of tools to make it easy to work with data collected during the 
Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS)
Field Campaign. 

IMPACTS data consists of various radars, microphysics probes, and other instruments flown on two planes
during snowstorms. IMPACTS-TOOLS simplies and speeds up development and analysis of the datasets by 
exposing a common interface for reading, processing, and plotting data from multiple instruments. 

IMPACTS-TOOLS also contains more specialized functions for advanced analysis as papers are published by 
the IMPACTS Science Team.
